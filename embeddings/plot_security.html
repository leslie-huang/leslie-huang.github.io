of day-to-day tactics, as the security forces fight it in Northern Ireland, and in terms of months and years, but it also has to be fought on the strategic level.", "That is fine for those with jobs\u00e4\u00f3\u00eejust as the security of tenure legislation was fine for those with furnished accommodation; but it makes it much more difficult for people to obtain jobs, or furnished fiats or rooms.", "The components of our social security system have been or are being reviewed.", "A wide range of services and benefits is available under the National Health Service, personal social services, the social security system and the Family Fund which was extended in 1974 to help families in which there is a severely handicapped child.", "Friend the Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker), who has had a much longer experience of the complexities of the social security provisions \u00e4\u00f3\u00ee[ Interruption. ]", "There is a glaring gap in security when that kind of thing can happen.", "I cast it as narrowly as this to keep costs to a minimum, but I accept that there might be a problem, if only because most of us would like to see our social security legislation applied as even-handedly as possible to all in this country without too many of these distinctions.", "This is the central misrepresentation of the whole devolution case\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethe idea that more houses can be built, more jobs found, more happiness manufactured, more security and more unitl exist, if only we have an Assembly.", "Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Prentice), who spoke about the overlap situation, that there is an overlap between social security payments and wages because too many employers pay appalling wages and because of cut backs due to pay policy.",

by the security forces, I can assure the House that there is no restraint whatever.", "I have not said that I would withhold any support from the security forces in Northern Ireland.", "We shall go on protecting those who depend on the benefits of our social security schemes.", "While we appreciate that almost all our constituents who have suffered from bombs and bullets would say that the security forces should go into the areas where the rebels are found and wipe them out, we have counselled that that is not the way to go about it.", "But as regards items in which there is no security or technological content, it is wholly in the interests of a Western country such as this one to get the advantages of trade with the Soviet Union, and we intend to use the rest of the credit under this agreement if we can.", "We have to look at all the statistics and we have to be clear about the different types of violence, whether they take the form of attacks on the security forces sectarian

a firearm.", "I was in Rhodesia in the summer and I took the opportunity to cross-examine fairly closely the security forces on how the several thousand guerillas who are mostly in Mozambique were recruited.", "Members of this House know about problems which affect ordinary people concerning the immensely complex social security legislation that we pass through this House.", "I expect that the security and guarantee power of an instrument issued by an institution like the EEB, with a full guarantee bestowed on it by the Community, would have as blue chip and first-class a status of acceptability and recognition in the major international money markets as any such instrument issued by an equivalent American or Japanese institution, for example.", "I notice that the Gracious Speech states: There will be an annual increase in pensions and other social security benefits in order to protect the living standards of the most vulnerable.", "The disarray that would be caused in the NATO Alliance would place at risk the whole of the security of Europe, not least our own.", "For d\u00ed\u00a9tente without security is a contradiction in terms.", "For instance, taking the example of a British Government-guaranteed National Coal Board issue quoted at present in dollars and yielding a little over 8 per cent., and comparing that with a comparably dated British Government security yielding at present a little over 14 per cent., when this new foreign security bond has been issued, how will depositors be treated as the differential between the US dollar and sterling varies?", "It is enormous if one takes in every aspect of it\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethe guarding of property\u00e4\u00f3\u00eeeither static like offices or mobile in armoured vehicles or vans\u00e4\u00f3\u00eealarms and locks, industrial security, private detectives, store detectives, and so on.", "They should look into the possibility of introducing identity cards, because most social security frauds arise from people pretending that they are someone else.", "When one adds to all these questions about safety and health the political, military and social dimensions\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethe threat of terrorist activity, the vulnerability of nuclear sites to conventional attacks in war, the demands for greater surveillance, leading to security measures at variance with civil liberties, the need for international collaboration and control over the proliferation of nuclear weapons\u00e4\u00f3\u00eemy inescapable conclusion is that the Secretary of State should do two things.", "They have controlled now for a good many years the Bogside, the Creggan and the Shan-tallow areas, and only those who have no knowledge of the city\u00e4\u00f3\u00eeor those who are attempting to justify security policies which have failed in the city\u00e4\u00f3\u00eewill attempt to deny that simple fact of life.", "Do nothing to help Britain on the security of North Sea

situation in Northern Ireland.", "Friends and I are closely associated with social security measures.", "on employers' contributions to the social security fund is effectively a payroll tax.", "He is, no doubt, one of those who complain about scroungers and the amount of social security money that is handed out, yet here he is saying that we should give money to private industry with no control over that money and no accountability for it.", "But there is anxiety about the ease with which people with serious criminal records could penetrate private security firms for their own advantage, either as employees or as employers.", "I would have a Helsinki accord, in which I would agree to make great advances in humanitarian fields, and I would keep talking about detente until everyone in the NATO countries was lulled into a false sense of security.", "I do not think that the House should jump to too hasty conclusions over any breakdown in security arrangements at that institution.", "I believe that the number of people employed by private security firms in Britain exceeds the number of police that we have in uniform.", "While the whole of the \u008c\u00a3100 million for the coming year, or the \u008c\u00a3200 million for the following year, cannot be taken from the Polaris programme or the research and development programmes for modernising and developing strategic forces, when the Government look at where the cuts must be made\u00e4\u00f3\u00eeif, reluctantly, there must be cuts\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethey should look at areas where we may be duplicating forces which are adequately provided by the United States rather than cutting the conventional forces which we contribute to the central front, and which, I believe, are vital for the continued security of this country and the alliance as a whole.", "However, it does give me an opportunity to restate the essential elements of the Government's security policy in Northern Ireland.", "In the United States a total of 800,000 people worked for private security firms as opposed to 450,000 State or local police.", "Whether these are hopeful signs or not is a matter of opinion, but I suggest that there is a third movement, an evil movement\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethe rising tide of assassinations of security forces and across the sectarian divide.", "In the execution of their duty and in dealing with terrorism the members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary should not be treated differently under the law from the rest of the security forces.", "Those who have been subsequently captured by the security forces have shown in most cases a rudimentary knowledge, but a well-understood catalogue of the most elementary Marxist guerilla thinking.", "Partly through taxation, we have been able to increase social security benefits at the same rate as the increase in inflation and that has required a transfer from taxpayers to people on social security.", "The hospital's record is a good one, and I know that the hospital authorities have security as a constant preoccupation.", "Although we do not comment generally on security matters of this sort, I would regard it as very improper if foreign agents were attempting to influence the outcome of the Jamaican elections.", "To summarise, they are to the effect that if any further cuts were made other than those already made\u00e4\u00f3\u00eewhich had already caused us to reach danger point\u00e4\u00f3\u00eewe should be endangering the security of this country.", "Many private security companies are guarding public property.", "In reality, the security of this frail 82-year-old man is the responsibility of the highly competent civilian warders.", "I have no financial interest whatever in the private security industry.", "In view of the delicate nature of the Prison Service, the security aspects involved and the need to have good relations in our prisons as everywhere else, will my right hon.", "We hear of private security firms in the United States and the terrifying spectacle of men carrying sub-machine guns and rifles and driving around in enormous armoured vehicles.", "Nor, as has been snidely suggested in some quarters, is

to see the kind of ethos in which the private security firms in the United States operate.", "There have not been Press releases which said this has been dealt with only because of my responsibility for the security services.", "There are economic and security considerations.", "Let me utter here a word of warning that the attack on the CIA and on our own intelligence and security services is, wittingly or unwittingly, mounted on behalf of the KGB.", "Secondly, we all seem to agree, in principle at any rate, that the short-term benefits ought to be taxed, as they originally were when social security was introduced in the 1940s.", "If there is no hope of help from any quarter and one is in charge of security forces in such a situation, and if one knows that there are enemy camps across the border filled with men who are capable of an offensive operation such as that undertaken on Sunday, what is one supposed to do?", "It is significant that after a calculated verbal attack on the security forces there invariably follows the deaths of members of those forces.", "I have always regarded the introduction of child benefits as a major plank in the social security system.", "Given the security situation, there is nothing we can do.", "It is the legmen who blow themselves up, who get shot or who get arrested and convicted, while the organisers go round in smart cars, sometimes on American funds, and ride round the Province giving Harvey Smith signs to the security forces.", "In Wales, \u008c\u00a3187 per head is spent on social security compared with only \u008c\u00a3115 in England.", "I should like to touch on three more subjects: the tangle of confusion surrounding social security benefits and tax thresholds; the Resource Allocation Working Party exercise in the NHS, which seems to be producing real disruption in some regions; and the effect of the rate support grant settlement on the personal social services.", "Gentleman noted the statistics issued by his Department in regard to the county of Dorset\u00e4\u00f3\u00eenamely, that the amount of detected frauds in social security matters has multiplied threefold in 12 months?", "Landlords who are holding back property because they think that when the Tories come back there will be a property bonanza would then be encouraged to realise that security of tenure is here to stay and therefore to let

need as never before for support for the security forces and for the flow of information, and there is a need as never before for a realistic policy of apprehension and pursuit by the security

increase in homelessness in the last decade.", "They should stand on a par with the other security forces.", "He was incorrect in ascribing to the Opposition the view that we were mainly concerned at present with scrounging in social security.", "In those days job security had a tendency, in the words of J.

the hospital authorities have security as a constant preoccupation.", "Although we do not comment generally on security matters of this sort, I would regard it as very improper if foreign agents were attempting to influence the outcome of the Jamaican elections.", "To summarise, they are to the effect that if any further cuts were made other than those already made\u00e4\u00f3\u00eewhich had
