I am a PhD student in Data Science at NYU's Center for Data Science, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/spirling/">Arthur Spirling</a>. I have a BA, summa cum laude, from Columbia University, and an MA from NYU, where I was a PhD student in political science prior to joining Data Science.

## What I do

I use NLP to develop tools and estimation methods for analyzing text, especially in the context of political science. My dissertation is (tentatively) entitled "Contexualized NLP methods for unsupervised text analysis."

I help run the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/text-data-speaker-series/">NLP and Text-as-Data Speaker Series</a> at the Center for Data Science.

I'm a supporter of open source software and recently interned with the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny team at RStudio</a>. I've written a few R packages, described over <a href="/software">here</a>.
