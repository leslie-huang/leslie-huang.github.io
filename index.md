I am a AI research engineer at <a href="https://www.techatbloomberg.com/ai/">Bloomberg LP</a>. I have a PhD in Data Science from NYU, where I was the first person ever to defend a dissertation at the <a href="cds.nyu.edu/">Center for Data Science</a>.

My research interests include estimation methods for text, transfer learning, and NLP applications to political communication. I hold a BA, summa cum laude, in English literature and political science from Columbia University, and a MA in political science and a MPhil in data science from NYU. For details about my professional experience, visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/huangleslie/">LinkedIn</a>.

If you're an NYC-area NLPer, you might recognize me from NYU's <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/text-data-speaker-series/">NLP and Text-as-Data Speaker Series</a>, which I coordinated from 2017--2020.
