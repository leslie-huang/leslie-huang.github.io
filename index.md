I am a PhD candidate in Data Science at NYU's Center for Data Science. I develop NLP tools for understanding texts, with an emphasis on applications in political communication. My interests include representation learning, estimation methods for text, transfer learning, clustering methods.

My dissertation is entitled "Contexualized NLP methods for unsupervised text analysis in political science" (coming soon: spring 2021).

## About me

I have a BA, summa cum laude, in English literature and political science from Columbia University (2011); an MA in political science  from NYU (2018), where I was a PhD student in political science prior to joining Data Science; and an MPhil in Data Science from NYU (September 2020).

This summer, I am a research intern in the <a href="https://www.techatbloomberg.com/ai/">AI group at Bloomberg LP</a>. I previously interned with the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny team at RStudio</a>. Some of my ongoing projects are on <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang">GitHub</a>, but most are in private repos until they are ready for publication.
