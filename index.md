I am a PhD student in Data Science at NYU's Center for Data Science, where I will complete my doctoral studies in 2021. I use NLP to develop tools and estimation methods for understanding text, especially for social science analysis.

My dissertation is (tentatively) entitled "Contexualized NLP methods for unsupervised text analysis."

I have a BA (summa cum laude) from Columbia University, and an MA from NYU, where I was a PhD student in political science prior to joining Data Science.

## Where to find me

I help run the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/text-data-speaker-series/">NLP and Text-as-Data Speaker Series</a> at the Center for Data Science.

I have a few R packages on CRAN and recently interned with the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny team at RStudio</a>. Some of my ongoing projects are on <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang">GitHub</a>, but most are in private repos until they are ready for publication.
