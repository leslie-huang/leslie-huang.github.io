<h3>Who I am</h3>

I am a PhD student in Data Science at NYU's Center for Data Science, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/spirling/">Arthur Spirling</a>. I have a BA, summa cum laude, from Columbia University, and an MA from NYU, where I was a PhD student in political science prior to joining Data Science.

I use NLP and text-as-data to study political communication and behavior. My dissertation is (tentatively) entitled "Evaluating the state of democracy using natural language processing."

<h3>What I do</h3>

I develop tools for inference and estimation with text. I maintain <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stylest/">stylest</a>, the R package for textual style estimation. Install using `install.packages("stylest")`!

I help run the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/text-data-speaker-series/">NLP and Text-as-Data Speaker Series</a> at the Center for Data Science.

I've taught graduate-level labs at the Center for Data Science for <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/DataScienceCourse">Intro to Data Science</a>, a fundamental course on machine learning algorithms for business applications (in Python), and <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/Text-as-Data-Lab-Spr2018">Text-as-Data</a>, on text mining and NLP (in R).
