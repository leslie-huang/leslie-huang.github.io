<h3>Who I am</h3>

I am a quantitative political scientist and 3rd-year PhD student in the politics department at NYU, where I study methodology and comparative politics. I have a BA, summa cum laude, from Columbia University in political science and English literature.

<h3>What I do</h3>

I use text analysis and machine learning to extract information from textual data to answer questions about political behavior. I recently taught the R lab for <a href="text-as-data-lab/">DS-GA 3001 Text-as-Data (Spring 2018)</a> at NYU's Center for Data Science.
