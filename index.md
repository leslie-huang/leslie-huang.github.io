<h3>Who I am</h3>

I am a quantitative political scientist and 3rd-year PhD student in the politics department at NYU, where I study methodology and comparative politics. I have a BA, summa cum laude, from Columbia University in political science and English literature.

<h3>What I do</h3>

I use text analysis, machine learning and statistical analysis to uncover insights from text data and answer questions in comparative politics.
