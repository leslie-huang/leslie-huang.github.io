<h3>Who I am</h3>

I am a PhD student in Data Science at the NYU Center for Data Science, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/spirling/">Arthur Spirling</a>. In my research, I use NLP and text-as-data to study political science.

I have a BA, summa cum laude, from Columbia University, and an MA from NYU, where I was as a PhD student in political science prior to joining Data Science.

<h3>What I do</h3>

I maintain <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/stylest">stylest</a>, the R package for textual style estimation (on CRAN soon!).

For Fall 2018, I am a Section Leader (TA) for <a href="https://github.com/briandalessandro/DataScienceCourse">Intro to Data Science</a>.

Text analysis aficionados: see the archived lab materials for DS-GA 3001 Text-as-Data <a href="text-as-data-lab/">here</a>.
