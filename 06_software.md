### stylest: Estimating speaker style distinctiveness in R

I maintain the <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/stylest">stylest</a> R package, created with <a href="https://github.com/patperry">Patrick O. Perry</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/">Arthur Spirling</a>. It's written in R and built on top of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corpus/index.html">corpus</a>.

* Install  <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/stylest">stylest</a> from GitHub.

### Twitter network data scraper* (Python and R)

\* "scrape" from the Twitter API, not webscraping

(Backburner project.) I wrote some tools to scrape information about a Twitter user's followers and those followers' followers, in order to model networks between social media users.

* See the Python repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-ssscraper">here</a>, and the R repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-scrapeR">here</a>.

* I'm developing my work in R in another  <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitterNetworkGraphR">custom R library for scraping and visualizing n-degree networks</a>.
