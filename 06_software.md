## General use software

### leaflet.providers: map provider metadata for `leaflet`

I wrote <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet.providers/">leaflet.providers</a> while interning at <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> on the Shiny team.

* Install from CRAN using `install.packages("leaflet.providers")`.

### zipR: Pythonic zip(), aka a better cbind(), in R

I made <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zipR/">zipR</a>, an R package that implements Python-style zip().

* Install from CRAN using `install.packages("zipR")`.

* View a demo <a href="https://leslie-huang.github.io/zipr/zipr_demo.html">here</a>.

* Please report bugs on <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/zipR/issues">GitHub</a>!
