### Twitter network data (Python and R)

(On hiatus.) I wrote some tools to scrape information about a Twitter user's followers and those followers' followers, in order to model networks between social media users.

* See the Python repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-ssscraper">here</a>, and the R repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-scrapeR">here</a>.

* I'm developing another <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitterNetworkGraphR">custom R library for scraping and visualizing n-degree networks</a>.
