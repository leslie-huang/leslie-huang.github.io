many of the matters connected with this Bill\u00e4\u00f3\u00eeI have no precedent to guide me, and I must apply common sense to the construction of the statute.", "The common fisheries policy requires us to give other member States access to our waters beyond the six to 12-mile band which is reserved until 1982 for our fishermen under the Treaty of Accession.", "On the face of it, the Common Market was about the free movement of labour and capital and the free market forces theory, yet superimposed above it, below it, and taking it over, was the common agricultural policy, which had built into it a superstructure of controls from beginning to end.", "I ask the Minister whether, under existing legislation and ideas the common fisheries policy is prepared to allow a completely exclusive 12-mile zone.", "Not only do they share problems common to the rest of the country, but they have many difficulties peculiar to big city life.", "I do not really believe that the provisions of Articles 100 to 103 of the Treaty of Accession were anything but a reasonable approach to the problems of fisheries, given that, not with our will, the common fisheries policy had been entered into by the Six.", "But, out of some 30,000 men under training at any given time, there are not more than 2,000 being trained on an agency basis, and the number of common Service establishments is very few.", "That is quite common practice.", "Second, on the question of energy, there was a proposal that, as there is no complete energy policy now in the complete Community, we should concentrate on a common policy of conservation.", "asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on reform of the common agricultural policy.", "It is also axiomatic that any political body of 24 men and women is unlikely to agree on anything more sensible than the lowest common denominator of any policy.", "The proposals for reference prices for imports of new potatoes from third countries coupled with an early increase in the common customs tariff could, as the Scrutiny Committee has recognised, inhibit our traditional practice of importing new potatoes from these countries in the early spring to bridge the gap between our old and new home crops, and this is another feature of the proposals in which we see particular difficulty.", "It is a victory for common sense that that should be the case in this House.", "The real crunch comes with the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy.", "Over the past six months, progress has been made to adapt the common fisheries policy to the new situation.", "It can be argued that we of all the Community countries least need common policies since the reduction of our dependence on imported energy is daily taking care of itself.", "The Opposition feel that this is, in broad outline, a useful document which was becoming inevitable not only from the point of view of its essential elements in the creation of a common market in all sorts of financial and economic activities, banking being one of the biggest, but from the point of view of the troubles that we have had in this country and which other countries with stricter banking control regimes have had.", "It also showed that the institutions of the Community are not sufficiently developed to provide common solutions to these problems, which are intensified by the growing divergence between the economies of various member States.", "Ought there not to be some attempt to get some economies to make up for increased prices by doing common purchasing?", "The next major issue dealt with at the Paris Conference was that of commodities and the problem of the common fund.", "There are many aspects of the common agricultural policy that I have to defend, but on the specific point raised by the hon.", "He has listened to a very sober and tightly argued debate about the revision of the common fisheries policy.", "Both the Foreign Affairs Council on 13th and 14th December and the joint meeting with Agriculture Ministers on 14th December are likely to discuss the external and internal aspects of the common fisheries policy.", "At a time when we are discussing a common regional policy within nine independent countries in the EEC, the idea that such limited but nevertheless important and valuable variations as a Scottish Assembly would be a threat to the whole United Kingdom economy and puts it out of balance and is an invalid argument.", "I think that, in the context of the fears and, perhaps, hopes for the future of the common fisheries policy, that is an important statement from the Commissioner responsible.", "In general, I can see nothing in the situation at the factory that a little good will and common sense could not resolve.", "This is, therefore, becoming a common practice on the Bill.", "Friend back to one of his earlier replies when he was being pressed about the common agricultural policy and when he, I thought, said realistically that the nations of the European Common Market were conditioned by their own self- interest?", "This is an issue on which there is no common view.", "This is what lies behind the new dimension to fishing policy which the common fisheries policy must now reflect\u00e4\u00f3\u00eenamely, the extension of fishing limits to 200 miles.", "Since Ministers in the Department of Industry, in common with their Conservative predecessors, have been guilty of abject failure in regenerating Scottish industry, will the Minister assure the House that he and his colleagues will support SNP amendments to the Scotland and Wales Bill to give real control over industry in Scotland to the Scottish Assembly?", "The decisions reached at Community level on the 200-mile limit and the agreement to which the Government of the United Kingdom subscribed at The Hague in common with other Community States do not in any way prejudice the United Kingdom Government's view on exclusive coastal zones.", "But that is about all we have in common.", "Friends and myself\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethat we should avoid any differentiation between the law in Northern Ireland and that in the United Kingdom and that, wherever possible, common statutes should be passed by the House of Commons for the whole of the United Kingdom, or at any rate, statutes which include Northern Ireland.", "I am glad that on this occasion, tardy though they have been, the Government have acted a lot faster than they did in the 1960s, when it was obvious that a 12-mile limit was to become common.", "The Labour movement in Scotland recognises that we shall achieve the kind of society that we want only if we all work together in a common cause for a common purpose.", "The Commission dumping proposals will, by common consent, require considerable modification if they are to command acceptance in the countries of the Community.", "asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he is satisfied with the progress of renegotiation of the common fisheries policy.", "The Bill does not solve the problems arising out of the common fisheries policy, though it does, as I shall show, enable us to introduce limits on our internal waters when the time comes.", "That is clearly unsatisfactory, and to prevent it, fixed rates of exchange known as green rates were introduced for the conversion of common prices.", "For example, the common agricultural policy may have met with many failures but no one could say that there has not been much effort and much discussion.", "But if we can move in a common direction, our negotiating position on reciprocal fishing rights and the control of fishing by other nations will be the stronger.", "The Canadians failed to make a success of it, and it would be a fatal mistake in producing integration, common purposes and common training for our Services to get rid of units which had proved to be a complete success over the years.", "In the Northern Region

policy of conservation.", "asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on reform of the common agricultural policy.", "It is also axiomatic that any political

countries coupled with an early increase in the common customs tariff could, as the Scrutiny Committee has recognised, inhibit our traditional practice of importing new potatoes from these countries

common consent, the business of the Government during this year has been uniquely badly mismanaged.", "I should not repeat any of the arguments about the common fisheries policy which we have already discussed fully.", "The Minister spoke with his usual courtesy, and I believe that he will show fundamental common sense in this matter.", "The Community has no common industrial or transport

common sense.", "Three points seem to me to stand out The first is that over many years there has been repeated concern on this issue of the payment of unemployment benefit to occupational pensioners and, what is more, common concern by Governments of both parties to deal with it.", "I know that there are differences of opinion about the best possible system, but there is common ground on both sides, first, that without a passenger subsidy there would be a very small network, which would not meet social needs, and, secondly, that the management must have some discretion within the statutory procedures.", "I remind the Government of what we are contributing to the common fisheries pool and the diversion of effort for the deep sea fleet that will inevitably take place from Iceland into our waters.", "In the meantime the OPEC countries \u00e4\u00f3\u00eewhich have allied themselves with the developing world, since they have many common problems with it \u00e4\u00f3\u00eehave made a

and more positive encouragement to workers' co-operatives and common ownership enterprises?", "The board, in its annual report for the year ended 31st December, said, on page 8: In the Board's view a revised common fisheries policy must make provision for a coastal state preference, acknowledgment of which is becoming increasingly recognised as an important element in the current arrangements for conservation of overexploited fish stocks.", "The Bill will enable us to implement whatever agreements on fishing rights are reached with third countries and whatever agreement is reached on a revised common fisheries policy.", "It is worth remembering that renegotiating the common fisheries policy, about which there is so much historical argument, really means that we are in a new ball game

harmonious industrial relations generally.", "I have told the Council that a common system is in my view desirable, but I need further evidence as to its educational feasibility and agreement on a new administrative structure before taking a final decision.", "So that, whether or not we start with quotas, it seems to me that both in terms of the common fisheries policy\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethe regime

studying the difficulties of the failure to have common operational machinery\u00e4\u00f3\u00eefor example, to get different national aircraft to operate from the same airfields.", "I presume that that is to some extent common between EEC members and to some extent agreed with them.", "To arrive at a fair implementation of the own resources proposal requires an agreed basis of calculations so that, even in those cases where one of the Community countries does not charge value added tax on some category, at any rate the calculations can be common and the contributions of each of the countries can be calculated on a common basis.", "asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what modifications to the common agricultural policy have been achieved by Her Majesty's

Committee can draw to assess what is the Government's true intent and thinking about the problem of the commuter, seem to me to bring out three common features.", "In the illustrations I have given, I suggest that there is sufficient evidence of the need for a much more active investigation into the subject of common training not only along the lines of the Expenditure Committee but also in a much more thorough way.", "I am worried about the revision of the common fisheries policy because in practice the Government have run down bargaining strength over the years.", "Friend the Minister has

common agreement on the Labour Benches that the Government's industrial objective, as they have declared it, of seeking to get a greater development of export-led industrial success has been endangered, as the Government have admitted, by some of the levels of what we hope will be temporary interest rates.", "Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) signed the Treaty of Accession and accepted the common fisheries policy in January 1972, the Minister representing the Government in the Lords, Lady Tweedsmuir, said positively that it did not matter because we had a bargaining weapon and we could

ground.", "I assure them that the sponge will not be passed over the memory and the record of the conflict with economic common sense, the conflict with sound financial management, the conflict with the supreme national duty in the years 1970\u00e4\u00f3\u00f174, until most of those who were co-operators, connivers or consenters to those events have passed elsewhere.", "In the common fisheries

comprehensive form of secondary education.", "There was common interest in trying to ensure that the growth of activity, both in the Community and in the rest of the world, should not slow down and in finding constructive ways of tackling our common problems in a Community framework.", "Clearly it is not possible for me to deal with those subjects in the same detail, but it surely must have

farces in Europe, have the Government any positive proposals for its reform?", "Looking at the history of our respective countries, which have been in partnership for so long, I think we are apt to underestimate the common sense and the affinity of our peoples if we do not accept that, in any European federation, if England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland would very much pull together.", "A revised

us to give other member States access to our waters beyond the six to 12-mile band which is reserved until 1982 for our fishermen under the Treaty of Accession.", "On the face of it, the Common Market was about the free movement of labour and capital and the free market forces theory, yet superimposed above it, below it, and taking it over, was the common agricultural policy, which had built into it a superstructure of controls from beginning to end.", "I ask the Minister whether, under existing legislation and ideas the common fisheries policy is prepared to allow a completely exclusive 12-mile zone.", "Not only do they share problems common to the rest of the country, but they have many difficulties peculiar to big city life.", "I do not really believe that the provisions of Articles 100 to 103 of the Treaty of Accession were anything but a reasonable approach to the problems of fisheries, given that, not with our will, the common fisheries policy had been entered into by the Six.", "But, out of some 30,000 men under training at any given time, there are not more than 2,000 being trained on an agency basis, and the number of common Service establishments is very few.",

policy of conservation.", "asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on reform of the common agricultural policy.", "It is also axiomatic that any political body of 24 men and women is unlikely to agree on anything more sensible than the lowest common denominator of any policy.", "The proposals for reference prices for imports of new potatoes from third countries coupled with an early increase in the common customs tariff could, as the Scrutiny Committee has recognised, inhibit our traditional practice of importing new potatoes from these countries in the early spring to bridge the gap between our old and new home crops, and this is another feature of the proposals in which we see particular difficulty.", "It is a victory for common sense that that should be the case in this House.", "The real crunch comes with the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy.", "Over the past six months, progress has been made to adapt the common fisheries policy to the new situation.", "It can be argued that we of all the Community countries least need common policies since the reduction of our dependence on imported energy is daily taking care of itself.", "The Opposition feel that this is, in broad outline, a useful document which was becoming inevitable not only from the point of view of its essential elements in the creation of a common market in all sorts of financial and economic activities, banking being one of the biggest, but from the point of view of the troubles that we have had in this country and which other countries with stricter banking control regimes have had.", "It also showed that the institutions of the Community are not sufficiently developed to provide common solutions to these problems, which are intensified by the growing divergence between the economies of various member States.", "Ought there not to be some attempt to get some economies to make up for increased prices by doing common purchasing?", "The

14th December and the joint meeting with Agriculture Ministers on 14th December are likely to discuss the external and internal aspects of the common fisheries policy.", "At a time when we are discussing a common regional policy within nine independent countries in the EEC, the idea that such limited but nevertheless important and valuable variations as a Scottish Assembly would be a threat to the whole United Kingdom economy and puts it out of balance and is an invalid argument.", "I think that, in the context of the fears and, perhaps, hopes for the future of the common fisheries policy, that is an important statement from the Commissioner responsible.", "In general, I can see nothing in the situation at the factory that a little good will and common sense could not resolve.", "This is, therefore, becoming a common practice on the Bill.", "Friend back to one of his earlier replies when he was being pressed about the common agricultural policy and when he, I thought, said realistically that the nations of the European Common Market were conditioned by their own self- interest?", "This is an issue on which there is no common view.", "This is what lies behind the new dimension to fishing policy which the common fisheries policy must now reflect\u00e4\u00f3\u00eenamely, the extension of fishing limits to 200 miles.", "Since Ministers in the Department of Industry, in common with their Conservative predecessors, have been guilty of abject failure in regenerating Scottish industry, will the Minister assure the House that he and his colleagues will support SNP amendments to the Scotland and Wales Bill to give real control over industry in Scotland to the Scottish Assembly?", "The decisions reached at Community level on the 200-mile limit and the agreement to which the Government of the United Kingdom subscribed at The Hague in common with other Community States do not in any way prejudice the United Kingdom Government's view on exclusive coastal zones.", "But that is about all we have in common.", "Friends and myself\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethat we should avoid any differentiation between the law in Northern Ireland and that in the United Kingdom

this occasion, tardy though they have been, the Government have acted a lot faster than they did in the 1960s, when it was obvious that a 12-mile limit was to become common.", "The Labour movement in Scotland recognises that we shall achieve the kind of society that we want only if we all work together in a common cause for a common purpose.", "The Commission dumping proposals will, by common consent, require considerable modification if they are to command acceptance in the countries of the Community.", "asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he is satisfied with the progress of renegotiation of the common fisheries policy.", "The Bill does not solve the problems arising out of the common fisheries policy, though it does, as I shall show, enable us to introduce limits on our internal waters when the time comes.", "That is clearly unsatisfactory, and to prevent it, fixed rates of exchange known as green rates were introduced for the conversion of common prices.", "For example, the common agricultural policy may have met with many failures but no one could say that there has not been much effort and much discussion.", "But if we can move in a common direction, our negotiating position on reciprocal fishing rights and the control of fishing by other nations will be the stronger.", "The Canadians failed to make a success of it, and it would be a fatal mistake in producing integration, common purposes and common training for our Services to get rid of units which had proved to be a complete success over the years.", "In the Northern Region there is much more common concern and interest in industry and in other ways which might make it a suitable place for work of that kind.", "Presumably, the Bill is in part framework legislation within which the common fisheries policy will be revised.", "It is clearly imperative common sense that we expand our planting programme considerably.", "The proposals are for a common structure and for a common coverage\u00e4\u00f3\u00eethat is, common as to those articles and services that are to be taxed and those that are not to be taxed.", "These complaints are not surprising because, by almost common consent, the business of the Government during this year has been uniquely badly mismanaged.", "I should not repeat any of the arguments about the common fisheries policy which we have already discussed fully.", "The Minister spoke with his usual courtesy, and I believe that he will show fundamental common sense in this matter.", "The Community has no common industrial or transport policies, whilst a common foreign policy, still outside Community competence, is little more than a dream \u00e4\u00f3_ the Community has ground to a halt.", "Britain and Ireland seek, as part of a revised common fisheries policy, the establishment of coastal bands around the coasts of all member States.", "But, in common with my hon.", "Gentleman confirm that one of the reasons for the delay in informing the Health and Safety Inspectorate or himself about this matter was that local experts at Wind-scale took the view that this was a common occurrence?", "The common fisheries policy was put together in circumstances which are different from those of today.", "There is no doubt that the union, in common with many other trade unions and many hon.", "In the present economic situation it is surely common sense for the Government to consider where savings can be made in the social security budget by removing or diminishing the title to benefit of people who have adequate financial provision from another source.", "All parties in the House except the nationalists want the United Kingdom to remain united, yet there has been no attempt to reach common ground in the interests of the United Kingdom, to analyse and diagnose the problem which we all appreciate exists or to recommend possible changes and improvements.", "Friends and myself have not enabled us to perceive where the law of Northern Ireland so differs from that in the rest of the United Kingdom that the provisions of Clause 10 are necessary to achieve our common purpose.", "Sometimes people feel that because they have passed a resolution or made a statement, a common transport policy will result.", "Though the directors are all good military people, they have an extremely complacent attitude about the need for common training and working together to see whether considerable economies can be made.", "In reading through the Bill, therefore, one cannot ignore those parts of it which have been written very much with the negotiations with the EEC in mind, and particularly the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy.", "The Public Accounts Committee, in making these criticisms, has shown itself to be rather short of common sense.", "I am speaking on behalf of my party, common sense, myself, and all the good people of Scotland.", "I share a common cause with the hon.", "At a time when we are hard pressed financially, the proposals for Scotland are a travesty of common sense.", "I shall try to save the time of the House by not referring at length to the Defence Estimates except to say that

nonsense.", "It is possible to shape a common policy between the main parties on these matters.", "I want to diverge slightly to urge the Minister to co-operate with the EEC countries in forming a common policy towards the threat of Japanese shipbuilding.", "Friend if his view is that the so-called common agricultural policy is not based on the best use of resources in the Community or, indeed, in some of the member States.", "He will find a great deal of concern, argument, and debate about the lack of action on the part of Community transport Ministers in implementing a common transport policy.", "The Community as a whole should in our view be capable of this fairly undemanding gesture of common interest.", "We have pointed to the advantages which our present system has brought us, but we have to try to find a common solution, and I think that it is right to start with an open-minded approach, while not forgetting the benefits which our own system has achieved.", "What is necessary is a common basis for the calculation of own resources.", "Therefore, if pressure is applied, there can be rationalisation, and I should have thought that those whom I have mentioned could
