## Make factor variables and find the levels of your factors

This example will use the `mtcars` dataset from the `datasets` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(mtcars)
```

Currently, the `gear` variable is numeric.


```{r}
class(mtcars$gear)
```

Suppose we wanted to transform it into a factor variable.

```{r}
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
```

The dataframe looks the same, but the `gear` variable is now a factor.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

We can confirm that `gears` is a factor:

```{r}
is.factor(mtcars$gear)
```

And we can view the levels of the factor:

```{r}
levels(mtcars$gear)
```
