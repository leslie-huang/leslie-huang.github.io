### zipR: implementing Python-style zip() in R

I wrote an R library to implement one of my favorite built-in Python functions: zip().

* Install the current version of the package from <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/zipR">GitHub</a>.

* View a demo <a href="https://leslie-huang.github.io/zipr/zipr_demo.html">here</a>.

* Please submit bugs/feature requests by opening an issue on GitHub.


### Twitter network data scraper* in Python and R

\* "scrape" from the Twitter API, not webscraping.

(In progress.) I wrote some tools to scrape information about a Twitter user's followers and those followers' followers, in order to model networks between social media users.

* See the Python repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-ssscraper">here</a>, and the R repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-scrapeR">here</a>.

* I'm developing my work in R in another  <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitterNetworkGraphR">custom R library for scraping and visualizing n-degree networks</a>.

### faRcSentiment:

For my MA Thesis project, I wrote an R package of sentiment analysis tools for estimating, smoothing, and plotting. The current version is narrowly tailored to my project; refactoring it to accept more general inputs is work still in progress.

* Install it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/faRc-sentiment-analysis-library">here</a>.
