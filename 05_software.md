### Twitter network data scraper* (Python and R)

\* "scrape" from the Twitter API, not webscraping

(Work in progress / backburner project.) I wrote some tools to scrape information about a Twitter user's followers and those followers' followers, in order to model networks between social media users.

* See the Python repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-ssscraper">here</a>, and the R repo <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitter-scrapeR">here</a>.

* I'm developing my work in R in another  <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/twitterNetworkGraphR">custom R library for scraping and visualizing n-degree networks</a>.

### faRcSentiment: sentiment analysis tools

For my MA Thesis project, I wrote an R package of sentiment analysis tools for estimating, smoothing, and plotting sentiment extracted from texts related to the FARC--Colombia peace negotiations. The current version is narrowly tailored to my project; refactoring it for general use is work still in progress.

* Development version on <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/faRc-sentiment-analysis-library">GitHub</a>.
