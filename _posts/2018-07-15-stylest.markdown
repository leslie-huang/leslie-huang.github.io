I'm very excited to announce the alpha launch of <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/stylest">stylest</a>, an R package for estimating textual speaker distinctiveness. I am the maintainer for this package, which was created with <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/spirling/">Arthur Spirling</a> and <a href="http://ptrckprry.com/">Patrick Perry</a>.

* Install  <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/stylest">stylest</a> from GitHub. (On CRAN soon!)

* View the <a href="https://github.com/leslie-huang/stylest/blob/master/vignettes/stylest-vignette.md">vignette</a> on GitHub.
